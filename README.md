### Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence COMP307 (Python)

This course covered ideas and techniques of artificial intelligence (AI). It provided a brief introduction to the history of AI and fundamental search techniques, as well as important machine learning topics and algorithms with their applications, including neural networks. It also addressed a selection of other important topics in AI. Some of the topics were the KNN algorithm, decision trees, search algorithms, neural networks, Bayesian networks, genetic programming, planning, and scheduling.

### Safety-Critical Systems SWEN326 (Java)

This course covered the concepts, techniques, and tools required for developing computer systems where safety and reliability are paramount. Topics included the concepts and principles underlying safety-critical systems and standards (e.g., DO178C and IEC61508); techniques for design validation (e.g., model checking); and implementation techniques for ensuring software correctness (e.g., coding guidelines, testing, static analysis, etc.). An avionics system was designed in Java for the course project.

### Software Development SWEN221 (Java)

This course developed a deeper understanding of object-oriented programming and associated practices. Topics included inheritance, polymorphism, genericity, lambdas, streams, optionals, error handling, testing, and debugging. Some the projects done were tetris game, card game and picture puzzle game.

### Software Design SWEN225 (Java)

This course developed a strong understanding of object-oriented design using design patterns, modeling, and programming techniques that support the analysis, design, and development of large and maintainable programs. Key design patterns covered included Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype, Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy, Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, and Visitor.

### Algorithms and Data Structures COMP261 (Java)

This course covered a range of algorithms and data structures, building on the fundamental structures from the first year. Key concepts learned were graph algorithms, pathfinding, flow networks, Huffman coding, Lempel-Ziv coding, string search, and parsing with regex.

### Secure Programming CYBR271 (C)

This course addressed concepts, techniques, and tools required for developing software that reliably preserves the security properties of the information and systems they protect. The course covered common software vulnerabilities, specifying security requirements, secure design principles, and techniques for evaluating software security. Practical work involved developing and evaluating the security of C and Java programs.

### Systems Programming NWEN241 (C/C++)

This course covered issues raised when programming at a low level, such as in embedded systems, OS system level, or network protocol stacks. It included working with C and C++.
