# Key University Courses
## Software Development SWEN221

This course developed a deeper understanding of object-oriented programming and associated practices. Topics included: inheritance, polymorphism, genericity, lambdas, streams, optionals, error handling, testing, and debugging.


## Software Design SWEN225

This course developed a strong understanding of object-oriented design using design patterns, modeling, and programming techniques that support the analysis, design, and development of large and maintainable programs.


## Algorithms and Data Structures COMP61
This course covered a range of algorithms and data structures, building on the fundamental structures from the first year.
Key concepts learned were Graph algorithms Path finding, flow networks, Huffman coding, Lempel-Ziv coding, String search. and Parsing with Regex.


## Secure Programming Cybr271

This course addressed concepts, techniques, and tools required for developing software that reliably preserves the security properties of the information and systems they protect. The course covered common software vulnerabilities, specifying security requirements, secure design principles, and techniques for evaluating software security. Practical work involved developing and evaluating the security of C and Java programs.


## Applied Statistics STAT292

This course introduced several statistical methods. Topics included non-parametric tests, design of experiments, one-way ANOVA and t-tests for the difference of means, factorial experiments, simple linear regression, analysis of covariance, binomial and Poisson distributions, two-way contingency tables, models for binary response variables, and log-linear models for two-way contingency tables.


## Systems Programming NWEN241

This course covered issues raised when programming at a low level, for example, in embedded systems, OS system level, or network protocol stacks. It included working with C and C++.
